# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

# Project description
the project contains two parts :
the first part i used vgg16 pretrained model architecture that built with Pytorch to classify flowers dataset that contains 102 categories through training,validating and testing and provide the top k probabilities for any image.
the second part was to build commandline application with python that receive inputs from user like the architecture of the model,hidden layers, number of epochs ..etc and provide the top k probabilities to the user

### Installation
to install the project you need to have.
1- Anaconda and jupyter notebook.
2- pytorch library.
3- download 102 categories of flowers dataset , you can download it from here http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html.
